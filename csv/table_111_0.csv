4,Data Lineage or Quality,GPS-derived Integrated Water Vapor.
5,Title,GPS-derived Integrated Water Vapor (Indian region)
6,Abstract,"This dataset contains Integrated Water Vapor (IWV) estimates derived from GPS receivers that comprise the GAGAN TEC network. These receivers have been installed at airports at various locations in India. The Zenith Tropospheric Delay was estimated from the GPS observations using the GAMIT software. Further, IWV was estimated from the ZTD values using surface temperature and pressure from ERA-I reanalysis as additional inputs. The GAGAN-IWV estimates for 1 year – March 2013 to February 2014 – have currently been made available."
