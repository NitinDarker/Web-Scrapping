4,Data Lineage or Quality,IMD gauge adjusted GSMaP_ISRO Rain
5,Title,GSMaP_ISRO Rain
6,Abstract,"The GSMaP_ISRO rain data has been derived through the IMD gauge based gridded rain & NOAA CPC gauge analysis adjustment of the GSMaP_MVK rain product. It offers high-quality rainfall information with excellent spatiotemporal resolution, covering a range spanning from March 2000 Onwards. It has been developed through the ISRO-JAXA Implementation of Agreement (IA). This product provides a lat/long grid with a 0.1° X 0.1° horizontal resolution, along with hourly temporal resolution."
