5,Title,Inland Water Bodies Monitoring using Satellite Altimetry over Indian Region
6,Abstract,"Inland water bodies? heightshave been estimated using SARAl-Altika and Jason-2 data over the two test sites, i.e. Ukai reservoir and Brahmaputra River (10 sites from upstream to downstream locations within the Indian region). The results were matched with the in-situ data collected from the GPS field trips and observed data collected from IWAI and CWC. In the first phase results of these two sites are presented herewith. Such 29 inland water bodies with (49 locations) are being done in the phase manner"
