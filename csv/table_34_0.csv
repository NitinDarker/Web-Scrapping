5,Title,Sea Ice Occurrence Probability Data over the Antarctic (SIOP36).
6,Abstract,"Antarctic Sea Ice Occurrence Probability (SIOP) for each day from January 1st to December 31st is generated from NSIDC sea ice concentration data (Comiso, 2000) which were downloaded from the NSIDC site: (http://nsidc.org/data). The SIOP data for 36 years (October 1978 to December 2014) are named as SIOP36"
