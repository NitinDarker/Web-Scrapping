1 Introduction 
SARAL-AltiKa is the ISRO-CNES joint collaborative project. SARAL is an acronym for 
"SAtellite for ARgos and ALtiKa" with two payloads namely AltiKa, a Ka-band (35-GHz) radar 
altimeter and ARGOS, a data collection platform for a variety of physical and biological data 
from ocean in-situ instruments like Ocean buoys etc. SARAL realizes ocean radar altimetry 
through a suite of altimetry payloads which includes the DORIS and LRA instruments for 
precise orbit determination (POD); a dual-frequency microwave radiometer (MWR) at 
24/37GHz for water vapor correction.  At 35 GHz, not only is the ionospheric contamination of 
the pulse echo negligible, it also gives a better vertical resolution of about 0.3m for wave 
estimation and a compact, light-weight instrument for greater portability.  
The objectives of AltiKa mission are: To realize precise, repetitive global measurements of sea 
surface for studying mesoscale variability, developing coastal oceanography, inland waters and 
ice sheets monitoring and understanding of climate change.  
This document is User Handbook for the “Moving closer to the coast by SARAL/AltiKa: 
Geophysical Product for Indian Mainland Region”. This product was conceived in the 
framework of deriving high resolution “Coastal Product” project under SARAL/AltiKa mission.   
This coastal product is an experimental product derived from SARAL/AltiKa S-IGDR tracks. 
The document provides an insight to coastal product and various algorithms used in its 
derivation. It is advised that user refer the SARAL/AltiKa product handbook (SARAL/AltiKa User 
Handbook, Dec, 2013), as present document is an add-on with specific retrackers and quality flags 
for 40-Hz data processing.

50 km from the coast.

1.1 Overview of the product 
In Open Ocean, the altimetric echo follows a standard shape, with steeply rising leading edge 
followed by a trailing edge with gradually diminishing power. This standard shape is in 
agreement with the theoretical Brown model (Brown 1977) and hence can be easily modeled. 
Output of the Brown model is sea surface height (SSH), significant wave height (SWH) and 
backscatter coefficient (Sigma (0)). Sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) is further computed 
from SSH. The waveforms measured in the coastal area do not conform to the theoretical Brown 
model due to land contamination and inaccurate geophysical corrections.  Special data 
processing efforts are needed for coastal region. SARAL/AltiKa coastal product is concerned 
with providing the geo-physical parameters SSHA, SSH, SWH and Wind Speed from the 
retracking algorithms BETA5, BETA9 and BAGP at 40-Hz data rate. The distance between the 
consecutive points in the 40-Hz data is approximately 180 meters. Geophysical products have 
been computed along the tracks of SARAL/AltiKa in the coastal regions of Indian Mainland. 
The tracks are shown in Fig. 1 in white. List of tracks are provided (in ascending order) here:

3. Processing involved in the coastal product and parameters provided 
Prior to describing, the processing involved in deriving coastal products, it will be useful to 
understand the procedure involved in the computation of geo physical parameters from altimeter 
in the open ocean. In the following sections we first discuss the open ocean altimeter data 
processing. 
 
3.1 Altimeter Data Processing for Open Ocean 
Basic measurement of an altimeter is in form of a time series known as waveform in which 
power is distributed along various measuring gates of an altimeter as depicted in Figure 2. These 
gates arise due to signal processing and decide the vertical resolution of the altimeter. A model is 
fitted to the altimeter waveform, and the model parameters provide the geophysical parameters 
or their corrections. Fitted model is shown as blue curve in the same Figure. This process of 
modeling the altimetric waveform is known as retracking and the specific model used for 
retracking is known as a retracker.  A theoretical model (known as MLE4 retracker), based on 
the scattering of a radar pulse from the sea-surface, was formulated by Brown (1977) and is 
extensively used for open ocean waveform retracking.

To the first order, this model is given as by Amarouche et al. (2004)

𝛽 = (4/𝛾)(𝑐/ℎ)1/2𝑠𝑖𝑛 (2𝜉) , 𝛿 = (4/𝛾)(𝑐/ℎ)𝑐𝑜𝑠(2𝜉)

𝛾 = (1/2)ln2 sin2θ-3dB, θ-3dB being the half-power antenna beam width.

𝜎𝑐 is the composite rise-time

where 𝜎𝑝 is radar antenna parameter  and 𝜎𝑠 is the RMS surface elevation . 
Brown Model and the retrieved parameters are shown in Figure. 3. Note that thermal noise is 
also present in the actual altimetric waveforms. 
 
Figure 3. Brown model and the related retrieved parameters. 
 
Fitting the waveform model with the altimetric waveform is done using the Maximum 
Likelihood Estimator (MLE) technique explained in Amarouche et al. (2004). After fitting the 
theoretical model to the altimetric waveform three basic parameters are computed as described in 
the following sub-sections. 
 
 

6 
 
3.1.1 Computation of Sea Surface Height Anomaly  
Parameter 𝑡0 computed from equation 3.1 gives retracking correction to the range calculated by 
the onboard tracker on the satellite. The range is also corrected for the geophysical and the 
instrument corrections. 
Corrected Altimeter Range = Tracker Range + 𝒕𝟎 + geophysical corrections + instrument 
corrections. 
Altimeter range is then subtracted from the Altitude of satellite to give the SSH. Geophysical 
corrections in the altimeter will be discussed in the Section 5.  
SSH = Altitude - Corrected Altimeter Range 
Sea Surface Height Anomaly (SSHA) is then calculated by subtracting Mean Sea Surface (MSS). 
MSS is the long term mean of the Sea Surface Height calculated by averaging the SSH by the 
previous satellite altimeters. 
SSHA = SSH - MSS 
 
3.1.2 Computation of Significant Wave Height  
𝜎𝑐 from equation 3.1 is the composite rise time of the waveform. This parameter is obtained by 
fitting   the waveform with the theoretical model. Antenna characteristic 𝜎𝑝 is already known. So 
we can compute  𝜎𝑠 which is root mean square (RMS) surface elevation. 
(

2 - σp

where c is speed of light 
SWH is approximated as four times the RMS elevation 𝜎𝑠. 
𝑆𝑊𝐻 =  4𝜎𝑠 
 

7 
 
3.1.3 Computation of Wind Speed 
Wind speed is obtained generally using empirical relationships based on backscatter coefficient 
𝜎0 which is obtained by the ′𝐴′ term in the equation 3.1 as follows 
𝝈𝟎(𝒅𝑩) = 𝟏𝟎𝐥𝐨𝐠(𝑨) + 𝒔𝒄𝒂𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒇𝒂𝒄𝒕𝒐𝒓+ 𝒂𝒕𝒎𝒐𝒔𝒑𝒆𝒉𝒆𝒓𝒊𝒄 𝒄𝒐𝒓𝒓𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏
+ 𝒊𝒏𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒖𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝒄𝒐𝒓𝒓𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒔 
Scaling factor accounts for all the parameters of the radar equation except the amplitude of the 
waveform.  𝜎0 is also accounted for the atmospheric correction due to propagation in medium 
and the instrument corrections. 
The wind speed is calculated in S-IGDR by using one dimensional model given by Lillibridge et 
al. (2014) which is a function of backscatter coefficient. Equations for calculating   wind speed 
using one dimensional model are shown below 
𝑈𝑚= {𝛼−𝛽𝜎0              𝑖𝑓 𝜎0 ≤ 𝜎𝑏 
𝛾𝑒𝑥𝑝(−𝛿𝜎0)      𝑖𝑓 𝜎0  > 𝜎𝑏
  
 
 
 
(3.2) 
where 𝛼= 34.2, 𝛽= 2.48, 𝛾= 720, 𝛿= 0.42 and 𝜎𝑏= 11.4 
      Wind speed = 𝑈𝑚+ 1.4 𝑈𝑚
0.096 𝑒𝑥𝑝 (−0.32𝑈𝑚
1.096) 
One dimensional model from eqn. (3.2) is used for calculating wind speed from backscatter 
coefficient obtained from all the retracking algorithms.  
Note: In general, the geophysical parameters are calculated at 40-Hz and then averaged 
over 1-Hz by using some filtering procedure. But in coastal regions 1-Hz resolution which 
is approx. 7 km, is not very useful to provide the resolution needed for most of the coastal 
applications. 40-Hz data can be noisy due to limited averaging. Therefore, 40-Hz data can 
be used for research purposes in coastal regions.  It is suggested that the 40-Hz data should 
be filtered and averaged according to the specific applications. 
Geophysical parameters computed from the Ocean retracker as provided in the S-IGDR product 
are also provided. The list of these parameters is given below: 
SSHA                 ::     ssha_mle4_40hz

SSH                    ::     ssh_mle4_40hz 
SWH                  ::     swh_mle4_40hz 
WIND SPEED   ::      wind_speed_mle4_40hz 
 
3.2 Retracking algorithms used in the coastal product 
    Although eqn. 3.1 (ocean model) works well in the Open Ocean, in the coastal areas this 
model fails due to incursion of the land in the footprint of the altimeter as shown in Figure 4. In 
order to encounter this contamination, specific retracking algorithms are used in the coastal 
regions.  
 
Figure 4.  Sample waveform  in the Coastal Ocean from SARAL/AltiKa (red) and fitted with the 
Open Ocean model (blue). 
In coastal product we have provided three types of retrackers which are useful for the retrieval of 
parameters in the coastal region. These retrackers are discussed in the following sections. 
 
3.2.1 Beta retracker with exponential edge 
Martin et al. (1983) developed a retracking algorithm for processing altimeter waveforms over 
continental ice sheets.  This algorithm was used to retrack all SEASAT radar altimeter 
waveforms. This retracker was found useful in many coastal studies eg. Deng (2003)  

9 
 
The algorithm fits a 5 or 9-parameter function to the altimeter waveform. The first function is for 
fitting returns with single ramp in the trailing edge while the second one is used to fit returns 
with double ramps in the trailing edge. Single-ramp returns are modeled by 5-parameter model 
(Figure 5). The functional form for which is given in the equation below: 
W(t) = β1 + β2(1 + β5Q)P(
t-β3
β4 ) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3.3) 
where 
Q = {             0                          for  t < β3 + 0.5β4
t - (β3 + 0.5β4)        for  t > β3 + 0.5β4  
 
 
 
 
(3.4) 
                     𝑃(𝑥) = ∫

√2𝜋𝑒𝑥𝑝(
−𝑞2
2 ) 𝑑𝑞
𝑥
−∞
 
                    
 
     
   
 
(3.5) 
The unknown parameters related to a waveform are: 
1) β1 : Thermal noise level of waveform 
2) β2 : Return signal amplitude 
3) β3 : Midpoint on the leading edge of the waveform 
4) β4 : Return waveform rise-time 
5) β5 : Slope of the trailing edge 
β4 (the rise-time) is equivalent to 𝜎𝑐, the composite rise-time. The formula used to derive the 
SWH from the rise time is: 
σc
2 = σp
2 + (   
2
c σs )2  
 where c is speed of light

𝑆𝑊𝐻 =  4𝜎𝑠

Figure 5. Cartoon showing different parameters in the 5 parameter BETA retracker. 
In eqn. (3.6), 𝜎𝑐 is written instead of β4 to denote the composite rise-time. Please note that 𝜎𝑐        
is composite rise time and is slightly different from 𝜎𝑠  which is RMS of surface elevation.   
Simple form of eqn. 3.3 helps in encountering the contamination in the waveforms. 
9 parameter form of eqn. (3.3) is given as 
W(t) = β1 + β2(1 + β5Q1)P(
t-β3
β4  )+ 𝛽6(1 + 𝛽9𝑄2)𝑃(
𝑡−𝛽7
𝛽8 )     
 
 
(3.7) 
where 𝑃 is same as in eqn. 3.5 and  
𝑄1 and 𝑄2 are analogous to eqn. 3.4 as 
Q1 = {             0                         for  t < β3 + 0.5β4
t − (β3 + 0.5β4)        for  t > β3 + 0.5β4 
 
     (3.8) 
Q2 = {             0                         for  t < β7 + 0.5β8
t − (β7 + 0.5β8)        for  t > β7 + 0.5β8 
where β6, β7, β8and  β9 are the parameters of the second ramp in the waveform.  
1)  β6: Return signal amplitude of the second ramp 
2) β7 : Midpoint on the leading edge of second ramp in the waveform 

11 
 
3) β8 :  Rise-time of the second ramp in the waveform 
4) β9 : Slope of the trailing edge of the second ramp in the waveform. 
Various parameters in 9 parameter BETA retracker are shown in Figure 6. 
 
Figure 6. Cartoon showing different parameters in the 9 parameter BETA retracker. 
Deng and Featherstone (2006) gave a different expression than eq. (3.2) with exponential trailing 
edge for 5 parameters which is given as  
W(t) = β1 + β2exp(-β5Q)P(
t-β3
β4 ) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3.9) 
where 𝑃 is same as in eqn. 3.4 and  
Q = {             0                      for  t < β3-2β4
t - (β3 + 0.5β4)        for  t > β3-2β4 
 
 
 
 
 
(3.10) 
9 parameter form of eqn. (3.9) is given as 
W(t) = β1+β2exp(-β5Q1)P ( 
t-β3
β4  )(t) + β6exp(-β9Q2)P( 
t-β7
β8  )    
 
 
(3.11) 
where 𝑃 is same as in eqn. 3.5 and  

12 
 
𝑄1 and 𝑄2 are analogous to eqn. 3.10 as 
 
Q1 = {             0                         for  t < β3 −2β4
t − (β3 + 0.5β4)        for  t > β3 −2β4  
         (3.12) 
                                            Q2 = {             0                          for  t < β7 −2β8
t − (β7 + 0.5β8)        for  t > β7 −2β8 
Both BETA5 (Equation 3.7) and BETA9 (Equation 3.11) have been used to generate coastal 
products.  Reasons for specifically using BETA5 and BETA9 retarckers is because 
SARAL/AltiKa has very low mispointing angle which gives an exponential form to trailing edge 
of the waveform. So the linear trailing edge is not an appropriate choice for retracking. The 
method used for fitting model to the waveform is an iterative non-linear fitting approach, which 
is the least squares method with appropriate weighing scheme (Deng, 2003). 
Geophysical parameters derived from the BETA retrackers are provided in the coastal product as 
per the following naming convention: 
For 5 parameter BETA retracker 
SSHA                 ::     ssha_beta5_40hz 
SSH                    ::     ssh_beta5_40hz 
SWH                  ::     swh_beta5_40hz 
WIND SPEED  ::      wind_speed_beta5_40hz 
Similarly, for  9 parameter BETA retracker 
SSHA                 ::     ssha_beta9_40hz 
SSH                    ::     ssh_beta9_40hz 
SWH                  ::     swh_beta9_40hz 
WIND SPEED  ::      wind_speed_beta9_40hz

3.2.2 Brown with Asymmetric Gaussian Peak model (BAGP)  
This model adds the asymmetric Gaussian peak with the ocean type waveform in order to model 
the waveforms in the coastal region. Halimi et al. (2013) gave a Brown + peak model and 
implemented it by using MLE and Nelder-Mead unconstrained optimization method. The 
functional form of the model is given as: 
                                     𝑊(𝑡) = 𝑊𝑏(𝑡) + 𝑃𝑘(𝑡)   
 
 
 
 
 
(3.11) 
Where Wb(𝑡) is same as eq. 3.1 and the peak component Pk(𝑡) is given as  
 
                                 𝑃𝑘(𝑡) = 𝐴𝑘 𝑒𝑥𝑝 [
−1
2𝜎𝑘
2 (𝑡−𝑇𝑘)2] {𝛾[ 
(𝑡−𝑇𝑘)
√2 ] }          
 
 
(3.12) 
𝐴𝑘, 𝑇𝑘,  𝜎𝑘, and  𝛾 are amplitude, position, width and asymmetry coefficient of the peak 
respectively.   
Two type of fitting methods for this algorithm, following Halimi et al. (2013), are provided. One 
fitting is done by the least square method while the other is using Nelder Mead (Nelder et al, 
1965) method of fitting. The latter will be referred to as BAGP (nm). 
The geophysical parameters are provided as variables in the product as:  
SSHA                 ::     ssha_bagp_40hz/ ssha_bagp_nm_40hz 
SSH                    ::     ssh_bagp_40hz/ ssh_bagp_nm_40hz 
SWH                  ::     swh_bagp_40hz/ swh_bagp_nm_40hz 
WIND SPEED  ::      wind_speed_bagp_40hz/ wind_speed_bagp_nm_40hz 
 
3.3 Other related parameters 
These are some other parameters (not exactly geophysical products) related to retrackers that are 
important for inclusion in the product. They are described in the following sub-sections. 

14 
 
3.3.1 Backscatter Coefficient 
Backscatter coefficient (Sigma(0)) is an important parameter for wind speed computation. This 
variable is computed from each of the retrackers and are named as follows:   
sigma_zero_mle4_40hz for MLE4 retracker

3.3.2 Quality flags for retrackers. 
The retracking quality flags are provided in the coastal product in the following manner:  
flag_mle4_40hz for MLE4 retracker 
flag_beta5_40hz for 5 parameter BETA retracker 
flag_beta9_40hz for 9 parameter BETA retracker 
flag_bagp_40hz for BAGP retracker 
flag_bagp_nm_40hz for BAGP (nm) retracker 
This is a simple flag. Its value is zero if retracking has been performed.  
Note: Users must note that sometimes the retracking is successful but the fitted waveforms 
still do not fit the original waveforms. Therefore, an additional fitting quality parameter, 
mean quadratic error (MQE) is also provided. This parameter gives an idea about the 
errors in fitting from various algorithms. 
MQE is mean squared difference between the observed waveforms and the fitted model. 
Waveform and model waveform power are normalized by the maximum power in waveforms.

Lesser the MQE better the retracking result. MQE also depends on the noise content in 
waveforms and therefore relative MQE and the flags have to be checked before using the 
geophysical parameter. 
mqe_mle4_40hz for MLE4 retracker 
mqe_beta5_40hz for 5 parameter BETA retracker 
mqe_beta9_40hz for 9 parameter BETA retracker 
mqe_bagp_40hz for BAGP retracker 
mqe_bagp_nm_40hz for BAGP (nm) retracker 
Note: It is suggested that the both retracking flags as well as MQE should be checked 
before using the geophysical parameters from any retracker. Users can set a threshold for 
MQE for using the data. 
There is no rain flag in the SARAL data but an additional trailing_edge_variation_flag_40hz 
parameter is provided in the IGDR product. This flag accounts for the rain as well as presence of 
dense cloud as SARAL/AltiKa is more sensitive to water vapor than Ku-C dual frequency 
altimeters. Same flag has been provided in the product. 
 
4. Shape Classification of altimetric waveforms  
Different type of shapes of waveforms other than the standard deep ocean type (Brown type) 
waveforms are usually encountered in the coastal areas. The algorithms discussed in the Section 
3.2 were based on modeling the shapes of the coastal waveforms, so it becomes necessary to 
classify the waveform based on predefined shape. In coastal product a linear discriminant 
analysis (LDA) based technique was used to classify the waveforms on the basis of their shapes. 
As shown in the Figure 7 there are different types of shape in which waveforms are classified. 
Explanation of these classes is given as follows: 
Class 1: Brown type waveforms; which are characteristic for deep ocean and follows Brown 
model. 

16 
 
Class 2: Peak echoes; which are received due to high reflectance either due to still water 
presence or due to high reflection from land. 
Class 3: Very noisy type echoes; having a lot of noise and no shape feature is identified. 
Class 4: Peak at the end of echoes; found near land. 
Class 5: Brown + peaky echoes; these type along with class7 are received when both ocean and 
land exist in the footprint of altimeter. It is a mixed type of signal. 
Class 6: Linear; found near land or due to on-board tracker errors 
Class 7: Brown + peak on the trailing edge; described in class 5. 
Class 8: Peaky + Noise echoes; formed due to high reflectance from land in the footprint of 
altimeter.  
 
Figure 7. Different classes of waveforms   
Classification involves three steps: 
1) Feature selection   
2) Dimensionality reduction by LDA 
3) Class assignment by Bayesian classifier 

17 
 
More details are provided in the Chaudhary et al. (2015). 
The waveform class is provided as waveform_class variable in the product. In addition, original 
waveforms from the S-IGDR product as waveforms are also provided. 
Note: It is suggested to users should not use the very noisy (Class 3), peak with noise (Class 
8), Peak at the end (Class 4) and Linear (Class 6) because they have very high noise or 
tracker failures 
 
5. Geophysical Corrections  
There are various geophysical corrections which need to be applied to the range measurements to 
account for the signal delay. All these corrections are provided in the S-IGDR product as 1 Hz. 
The same values have been interpolated at 40-Hz using cubic spline interpolation.  No specific 
processing of the corrections in this version of coastal product has been done.  However, for the 
sake of brevity, standard corrections provided in S-IGDR version for 1-Hz are listed below: 
1) Dry Tropospheric correction 
This correction is due to the presence of the dry air medium between the satellite and the oceans 
which affects the velocity of propagation of the radio pulse. Its value is approx. -2.3 m and it 
varies very less. European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) numerical 
weather prediction models are used to compute the surface pressure (Chelton et.al ,2001) and 
then inverse barometer corrections. These values are provided in S-IGDR product. In the present 
coastal product, the variable dry_tropo_model_interp_40hz represents the 40-Hz interpolated 
dry tropospheric corrections. 
2) Wet Tropospheric correction 
This correction is due to the presence of water vapor and the liquid water. It is highly variable in 
the atmosphere and many times the correction reaches up to 40 cm. It is corrected in the open 
ocean by the use of onboard MWR at different frequencies. In the coastal areas, however, the 
radiometer itself is contaminated thus providing inaccurate corrections. Therefore, since the 
present product is within 50 km, wet tropospheric corrections calculated from the ECMWF 

18 
 
model is used. These corrections are once again interpolated to 40-Hz. It is provided as wet-
tropo_model_interp_40hz in the product. 
3) Tidal corrections 
There are three types of contributions to the tidal effect: 
a) 
Geocentric Ocean tide  
This correction is taken from the original S-IDGR data, interpolated at 40-Hz and is provided as 
geoc_ocean_tide_sol1_interp_40hz. It is calculated from GOT 4.8 Ocean Tide Model Ray 
(1999) 
b) 
Solid Earth tide 
This correction is taken from the original S-IDGR data, interpolated at 40-Hz and is provided as 
solid_earth_tide_interp_40hz. More details about this correction is provided in SARAL/AltiKa 
Product Handbook (December, 2013).  
c) 
Pole tide 
This correction is taken from the original S-IDGR data, interpolated at 40-Hz and is provided as 
pole_tide_interp_40hz. It is calculated in IGDR as described in Wahr (1985). Users can refer 
SARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook (December, 2013) for details about these corrections.  
4) Sea state Bias corrections 
This correction arises due to asymmetry of the reflecting properties of various scattering 
elements contributing for the average return. Troughs on the reflecting surface reflect better than 
the crests which creates the bias of the measured heights towards the troughs. Also the 
instrument measures the median rather than the mean scattering surface which creates an 
additional error. The distribution of the reflecting elements on the surface is skewed rather than 
symmetrical. This error is due to sea state and hence known as sea state bias. This is computed 
by empirical algorithms as described in Labroure (2004). This correction is provided as 
sea_state_bias_interp_40hz. 
 

19 
 
5) Ionospheric Corrections 
This correction arises due to slowing down of group velocity of radar pulse by the presence of 
free electrons in the ionosphere. Ionospheric correction in Ka band altimeter is one order less 
than Ku band altimeters. Dual frequency ionospheric correction is not possible in 
SARAL/AltiKa due to the absence of additional altimeter frequency. Therefore, external data are 
used to compute ionospheric correction.  Total Electron Content computed from GPS based 
observations and ionosphere model (JPL GIM model) are used to account for this correction. 
6) Inverse Barometer Corrections 
This correction corresponds to the change in sea level due to variations in atmospheric pressure 
variations. Higher the pressure lower is the sea level. It is computed from the surface pressure 
values as provided by numerical prediction model (NWP) and dry tropospheric correction. In the 
present version of the coastal product, it is provided as inv_barr_interp_40hz.   This correction 
given for 1-Hz data in S-IGDR has been once again interpolated to 40-Hz data.     
7) High frequency fluctuation Corrections 
This correction is ocean’s response to the wind and pressure and has energy at periods shorter 
than 20 days. It is considered as the departure from the inverse barometers effect to pressure and 
additionally wind effects. This correction is calculated by using specific models (SARAL/AltiKa 
Products Handbook, 2013). These corrections are interpolated at 40-Hz and provided as 
hf_fluctuations_interp_40hz. More details about this correction are in Stammer et al. (1999) 
and Tierney et al. (2000). 
 
6. Mean Sea Surface, Geoid and Bathymetry 
In order to compute the SSHA, MSS is required. SARAL/AltiKa S-IGDR product provides MSS 
from MSS_CNES_CLS11 model which is computed from 16 years of satellite altimetry data. 1-
Hz MSS data has been interpolated to 40-Hz.    

20 
 
There are two different geoid provided in the product. One is geoid_interp_40hz which is 
interpolated at 40-Hz from the EGM96 geopotential model (Lemoine et al., (1998)) provided in 
the S-IGDR data. 
Another one is geoid_sac, which is a high resolution geoid in the Indian Ocean (Sreejith et al., 
2013). 
Bathymetry is provided in the product from Sindhu et al. (2007) which is made using Smith and 
Sandwell, 2 minute bathymetry, ETOPO2v2, specifically corrected for the Indian Ocean region. 
 
7. Other parameters  
Some other parameters are also provided as listed below: 
1) Geolocation: The geolocation is provided as longitude_40hz, latitude_40hz 
2) Time: Time of the observation is provided as seconds since 2000-01-01 00:00:00.0. It is 
provided as time_40hz 
3) Distance from the coast:  This parameter is calculated from high resolution coastline created 
at Space Applications Centre (SAC).  It is provided as distance_from_coast_40hz 
4) Land Flag: This flag is calculated from high resolution coastline created at SAC. It is 
provided as land_flag_40hz. 
 
Note: It is suggested that users check the retracking quality flags, mqe threshold, distance 
from the coast, waveform class, trailing edge variation flag and valid parameter range for 
filtering out bad data values.
